esmetx is a high-throughput standalone ESME transmitter

Initial support is on SMPP 3.4 only by making use
of smpp34 and smpp34pdu libraries.

The basic idea behind esmetx is to encapsulate a queue
and a configurable number of high performing transmitter
channels to achieve a simple to use, highly configurable
and highly performant SMPP ESME transmitter.

Initially, the queue will be based on an internal implementation
but will later be extended to include support for using a RabbitMQ
instance or an EjabberD as the queue.
