Introduction
============

SPQ (Simple Persistent Queue) is really a poor man's persistent queue.

It's implemented just so that there is an included persistent FIFO with
esmetx for the new user that is easy to configure. The recommended way will
always be to integrate with an external system like RabbitMQ or EjabberD.

Architecture
============
SPQ is implemented as a gen_server.

SPQ just wraps up the erlang Queue module with rudimentary persistence. 
Nothing fancy, it will do for small deployments, but don't expect too
much from this.

Persistence is achieved simply by writing out the Lowly Queue to a DETS table.

Note that the DETS is only read from when the gen_server started up. During
normal operations, it is only written to.

Right now, to keep things simple without affecting performance of the basic
operations, this writing out is done periodically, by a spawned process so the
main process that handles messages is not blocked.

The implication of this type of persistence means that it is possible for data
to be lost if the gen_server crashes before the next persistence cycle comes
around.

This is an accepted limitation as the solution to this is to use a proper
persistent queue. This problem will not be given much thought.
