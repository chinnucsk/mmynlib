The watchdog module is a behaviour designed to keep the children of a
simple_one_for_one supervisor running.

watchdog, unlike a simple_one_for_one supervisor, is able to restart
a child, if it dies, by calling it with the parameters it was created
with, which is probably different for each simple_one_for_one child.

Also, watchdog unlike a simple_one_for_one supervisor, implements
incremental backoff when trying to [re]start the child process.

This allows for a well behaved module that auguments the functions of
a simple_one_for_one supervisor.

watchdog does not replace simple_one_for_one supervisors, but augments
their functionality.

Contraints
----------
    - Should very simple and non-invasive to the watched processes
    - Designed to be used ONLY with simple_one_for_one supervisors
    - Designed to be supervised at the _same_ level with its related
      supervisor.
    - Should concentrate only on keeping the children alive, restarting
      them and providing helper apis to help with managing that
