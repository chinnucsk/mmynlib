    - think carefully about also monitoring:
        - FailedStartTime: Last time the process failed to start
        - FailedStartups: Number of time process has failed startup
        
        - DeathTime: Last time the process died while running
        - Total Downtime: The cummulative total downtimes. Each
          downtime is a measure of the time betwen the last DeathTime
          and the time the process successfully restarts
